## About

The `Flask` üå∂Ô∏è project follows a RESTful API architectural style, emphasizing the principles of statelessness, resource identification, and uniform interface. By adhering to RESTful principles, the project aims to provide a clear and consistent approach to designing web services, promoting scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Create the environment (creates a folder in your current directory)

```bash
virtualenv .venv
```

In Linux or Mac, activate the new python environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or in Windows

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

### Installing

With the above application you can create a migration repository with the following command

```bash
flask db init
```

You can then generate an initial migration

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
```

You can then generate a empty file migration

```bash
flask db revision -m "Seed database"
```

Then you can apply the changes described by the migration script to your database

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

File `.env`

```bash
SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>
CLOUD_NAME=<cloud_name>
